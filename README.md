## What is it about ? 
It's an exercise where i had to code a forum where users can create an account, log in to the forum, post topics and add posts in each of it. <br>
Every users can see the informations of their profile. They can access to their username, their registration date and all the topics they created (they can click on it and access to every post related to the topic). <br> They can also choose to delete their account. All of their posts and topics will stay on the forum but they will not be associated to the user anymore. <br>
Some users can be "admin". If they are admin, they can see a list of all the users existing into the database. <br>
They can choose to ban/deban a user. Admins can also delete all the topics and posts that exist on the forum.

## What tools was used for this exercise ?
In order to code this forum, i used the following languages : PHP, SQL, HTML and CSS. I also used a framework that was created by my trainers.
